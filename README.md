# FitPoseTracker: AI-Powered Fitness Assistant

**Get fit with real-time exercise tracking and form feedback!**

FitPoseTracker is an innovative fitness application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to empower your workouts. By harnessing Mediapipe, a cutting-edge open-source framework, FitPoseTracker accurately detects your body posture in real-time, enabling it to count repetitions of exercises like push-ups, squats, and more.

This project goes beyond simple exercise tracking. FitPoseTracker incorporates machine learning techniques to provide valuable form feedback, helping you:

Optimize your workouts: Ensure you're performing exercises correctly to maximize the effectiveness of each movement.
Reduce injury risk: Avoid improper form that could lead to potential injuries.
Track your progress: Monitor your workout performance over time and celebrate your achievements.

## Features:

Real-time Pose Detection: FitPoseTracker uses Mediapipe to precisely detect your body keypoints, facilitating accurate exercise tracking.
Exercise Recognition: Counts repetitions of various exercises, including push-ups, squats, and others (expand on the list if supported).
Form Feedback: Provides valuable insights into your exercise form, helping you refine your technique for better results.
Progress Tracking: Track your workout history and visualize your progress over time.
